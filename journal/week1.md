# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

### 1. Watch How to Ask for Technical Help

#### 2. Watched Grading Homework Summaries

### 3. Watched Week 1 - Live Streamed Video
- Successfully followed along with the live stream. However, I encountered an issue. After saving text changes in backend-flask/services/home_activities.py they did not reflect on the frontend localhost:3000. Stopped and restarted both containers though now the entire center column of the page (where all the posts would have normally display) is empty though everything else displays on the page.

### 4. Remember to Commit Your Code

### 5. Watcked Chirag's Week 1 - Spending Considerations

### 6. Watched Ashish's Week 1 - Container Security Considerations
